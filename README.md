# NightGuard - Time-Controlled Motion Detection & Alarm System

A motion-triggered buzzer system that activates only during night hours. It utilises a real-time clock (DS3231), a PIR motion sensor, a keypad password for deactivation, and an OLED display for feedback.

---

## Features
- Triggers alarm only between 10 PM and 5 AM
- Requires a 6-digit password to deactivate
- User can enter '#' to reset input
- Displays time and messages on OLED screen
- Cooldown period after successful disarm
- Designed for veroboard or PCB

## How It Works
1. Motion is detected at night → alarm activates.
2. User enters password on keypad.
3. If correct → alarm stops + cooldown begins.
4. OLED displays live time and system status.
